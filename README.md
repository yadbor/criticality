# criticality
Code to support the circus/science show Critical by [yip-yip Circus](https://www.facebook.com/yipyipcircus/) featuring [Brenna](https://www.instagram.com/brenna_blue/). 

It is really good. Seriously, you should all go and see it if you get the chance.

This repository contains code to read the output of [Sensor Streamer](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/sensor-data-streamer/id608278214?mt=8) running on an old iPhone and display it to show the real-time angular velocity of an aerial hoop act.

This code requires pyqtgraph and was written for python 3 on OSX.
The code was inspired by & based on example code for pyqtgraph and others on the internet
